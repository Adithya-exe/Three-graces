# Three-grace

In this project, I wanted to show that creating a fancy design like this using #threejs is not as difficult as it looks. It has only 240 lines of code. The original design was created by Tom Bogner @dastom on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/6767548-The-Three-Graces-Concept.

I have done this project by taking Anderson Mancini's(github id : https://github.com/ektogamat) project on three graces as reference
